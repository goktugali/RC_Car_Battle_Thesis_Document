%% Edit below this line
First and foremost I am extremely grateful to my supervisors, Dr. Alp Arslan Bayrakçı and Prof Dr. Erkan Zergeroğlu for their invaluable advice, continuous support, and patience during this study. Their immense knowledge and plentiful experience have encouraged me in all the time of my academic research, industry career and daily life. I would like to thank all the members in the Computer Engineering Department of Gebze Technical University. Without their continuous support and sharing experience, it would be impossible for me to complete my study.  Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my parents who set an example for me with their lives.
