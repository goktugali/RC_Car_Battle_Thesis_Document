In today, smartphones have become the most essential thing in our daily life. Android application based smartphones are becoming more powerful each time and equipped with several accessories that are useful for robots. As smartphones evolve over time about computing power, gaming becomes more common. The motivation behind this work is combining hardware and software capabilities of a smartphone and an embedded system in order to create an environment which provides an online shooter game by controlling robots through smartphones.\\ 

In this paper, an online RC Car Battle framework is proposed. This framework provides an enhanced model of two remote controlled cars (RC) units designed on STM32 MCU, an application that runs on Android\texttrademark\;smartphones which supports playing shooter games between two RC Car units.
