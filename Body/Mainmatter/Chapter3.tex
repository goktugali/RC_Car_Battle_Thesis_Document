\chapter{Conclusions}
In this study, the RC car battle framework which provides an online game environment to users has been developed. The main motivation of this study is combining the capabilities of the smartphones and embedded devices for creating a framework which provides a multiplayer shooter game over the robot cars. Users play an online shooter game by their remote controller smartphone of the target RC car device, instead playing in a virtual environment.

Next version of this study can provide following functionalities for better game environment and user experience, since the technology behind the MCU and the smartphone of the system supports these features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding GPS to the RC car device in order to view the location of the car in the user interface while playing the shooter game.
    \item Adding options for steering control which are controlling with a button or a virtual steering wheel.
\end{itemize}
